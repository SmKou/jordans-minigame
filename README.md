# Jordan's Minigame

By: Stella Marie
A Pokemon-inspired game designed and developed for my dear nephew, where relationships and communication are the main interactions.

## Description

Geo: Geometric
Collectible creatures to befriend, care for, and battle. Their appearances consist of regular lines and shapes.

Fig: Figure
Humanoid creatures that fulfill communal and economic roles to help, befriend, battle against, and compete with. Their appearances consist of points, lines, and planes.

Recur: Recursive
Humanoid creatures that manage and protect the creatures of an area to help, befriend, and respect. Their appearances consist of patterns recurring on increasingly smaller scales, or rather fractals.

**Jordan's Minigame** is a prototype, wherein a player explores Undertown and interacts with its citizens to find their geos.
